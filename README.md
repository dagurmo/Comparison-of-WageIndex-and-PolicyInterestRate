ðŸ“Š Comparison of Interest Rates and Departures
This repository is part of the course Business Intelligence (I-707-VGBI) at ReykjavÃ­k University. The project explores the relationship between policy interest rates set by the Central Bank of Iceland and departures from KeflavÃ­k International Airport to analyze how economic factors influence consumer behavior.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Interest rates are a key economic tool used to regulate inflation and influence spending habits. This project investigates whether changes in policy interest rates have a measurable impact on outbound travel from Iceland, particularly in response to economic conditions and consumer spending power.

ðŸ“‚ Data Sources
Central Bank of Iceland â€“ Monthly interest rate data (2015â€“2024)
Icelandic Tourist Board â€“ Monthly departures of Icelandic residents from KeflavÃ­k Airport

ðŸ”§ Technology Stack
Programming: Python
Database: SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
Data Processing: SQL Power Query, Excel
Visualization: Excel, Pandas

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Make sure preferred SQL is installed on you computer. In this case PostgreSQL is used
Install dependency: pip install psycopg2

Create and load the data into the database: python load_data.py
View analysis results in excel for example. Note requires to connect the database to excel using Excel Power Query

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
A correlation exists between higher interest rates and a decline in outbound travel.
Travel was lowest during COVID-19 lockdowns, despite historically low interest rates.
External factors such as currency fluctuations and economic conditions also impact travel decisions.
